Scottish, Northern Ireland, and Wales governments all were advising that where possible, people should work from home prior. So therefore all 4 countries recommend staying home, these advisories were made by individual governments, not by NAT GOV for the whole of UK, hence coded as 0.      https://web.archive.org/web/20201004232124/https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/09/22/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus     https://web.archive.org/web/20201005123912/https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/coronavirus-lockdown-rules-four-nations-uk  ",0.00,,,,,,,2.00,,,,2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,1.00,,0.00,,0.00,,0.00,,,,,,,0.00,,,0.00,,,,,,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,0,,0,,403551,58386,NV,0.00,37.04,37.04,37.04,37.04,40.62,40.62,40.62,40.62,32.14,32.14,32.14,32.14,100.00

The following businesses and venues in England are due to reopen from 25 July, as outlined in the table below with links to guidance to ensure their safe opening: Indoor fitness and dance studios, Indoor gyms, Indoor sports courts and facilities, Indoor swimming pools and indoor water parks. So as of 22 July, some sectors are still closed in England. In the city of Leicester, which is under a stricter lockdown due to a rise in cases, most businesses are closed, though cafes and restaurants can operate takeaway services. I have coded this as a 2 (some sectors closed), as these are not essential workplaces, which is the same coding as the rest of GBR, so the coding remains as a 2G despite this internal variation within 2.

This move also simplifies the system to 3 categories, as well as the green watchlist to give travellers notice where green status is at risk.    arrivals from France will no longer need to quarantine if they are fully vaccinated  Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway to be added to the government’s green list for travel  India, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will also be moved from the red to the amber list  Georgia, Mexico, La Reunion and Mayotte added to the red list to safeguard domestic vaccine rollout    https://web.archive.org/web/20210806111415/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/international-travel-country-listings-update",2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,2.00,,1.00,,0.00,,0.00,,3.00,0,,,,,,5.00,1,,2.00,0,,,,,,,2,,3,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,5,,0,,5982581,157012,V,57.84,43.98,43.98,43.98,43.98,57.81,57.81,57.81,57.81,51.79,51.79,51.79,51.79,100.00

As the UK transitions from a period of pandemic emergency response to pandemic recovery, the focus will increasingly be on protecting those in society who continue to be more at risk of severe COVID-19. To achieve this, a planned and targeted vaccination programme is considered more appropriate than a reactive vaccination strategy.    For the 2022 autumn booster programme, the primary objective is to augment immunity in those at higher risk from COVID-19 and thereby optimise protection against severe COVID-19, specifically hospitalisation and death, over winter 2022 to 2023.    Accordingly, JCVI advises that for the 2022 autumn booster programme, the following groups should be offered a COVID-19 booster vaccine:    residents in a care home for older adults and staff working in care homes for older adults  frontline health and social care workers  all adults aged 50 years and over  persons aged 5 to 49 years in a clinical risk group, as set out in the Green Book, chapter 14a, tables 3 and 4  persons aged 5 to 49 years who are household contacts of people with immunosuppression  persons aged 16 to 49 years who are carers, as set out in the Green Book, chapter 14a, table 3    https://web.archive.org/web/20220816132227/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-updated-statement-on-the-covid-19-vaccination-programme-for-autumn-2022/joint-committee-on-vaccination-and-immunisation-jcvi-updated-statement-on-the-covid-19-vaccination-programme-for-autumn-2022",1.00,0,,,,,"In Scotland No legal requirements to wear face coverings as of 18 April 2022, but recommendation still in place on government website so recorded as a 1    https://web.archive.org/web/20220816193150/https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/",5.00,1,"There are 2 booster doses of the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine you may be able to get:    a booster for everyone aged 16 and over, and some children aged 12 to 15  a spring booster for people who turned 75 years on or before 30 June 2022, people who live in a care home for older people or people aged 12 and over who have a weakened immune system    https://web.archive.org/web/20220816000639/https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/how-to-get-a-coronavirus-vaccine/how-to-get-a-booster-dose/",2.00,0,,,,,,,2,"There are 2 booster doses of the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine you may be able to get:    a booster for everyone aged 16 and over, and some children aged 12 to 15  a spring booster for people who turned 75 years on or before 30 June 2022, people who live in a care home for older people or people aged 12 and over who have a weakened immune system    https://web.archive.org/web/20220816000639/https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/how-to-get-a-coronavirus-vaccine/how-to-get-a-booster-dose/",3,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,5,,0,,23212565,204261,V,74.77,11.11,11.11,11.11,11.11,18.49,18.49,18.49,18.49,21.13,21.13,21.13,21.13,0.00

Exceptions continue to apply in some areas. If the number of COVID-19 cases continue to decrease in the local community over the coming weeks, it is hoped that the Trust will move to a further ‘gradual easing’ of restrictions. This will be reviewed on Monday 5 September 2022.    Important information on visiting any Western Trust hospital:  Two visitors (from FOUR nominees) are permitted to visit for one hour, once per day at the same time.  Maternity Services – birthing partner can attend twice daily. One other nominated visitor can visit once daily at the same time as birthing partner.  Neonatal Units – both parents or two nominated visitors to spend as much time with their baby as they wish.  Children’s Ward – Any child admitted to the Children’s Ward can be accompanied by two people (either/both parents or two nominated caregivers from up to two households), at all times for the duration of the stay. We would however ask that parents or other nominated visitors swap places (one person at a time at the bedside) to enable us to maintain effective social distancing.  Cancer Services – will remain unchanged. This is subject to local discretion in response to individualised risk assessment due to the vulnerability of the patients being cared for in these units  The Trust treats the safety of our patients, staff and everyone attending our facilities with the utmost importance and therefore strongly advise that anyone attending any of our facilities to visit a loved one, to take a lateral flow test prior to attending.  DO NOT ATTEND any Western Trust hospital or facility if you have any symptoms of COVID-19 or are a close contact of someone who is confirmed COVID-19 positive.  DO NOT ATTEND any Western Trust hospital or facility after Day 5 of testing positive. You should wait until after Day 10 before visiting.  All infection and prevention control measures MUST be adhered to when attending any Western Trust hospital or facility and this includes wearing a facemask properly which covers your nose and mouth at all times. In addition you must adhere to proper hand washing and social distancing guidelines at all times when visiting.  Based on high risk of COVID-19 transmission it is important to note that some wards are unable to allow visiting at this time and you will be informed of this when you ring to book your visit.  Depending on the continued level of COVID-19 transmission in the community, all temporary measures are subject to review.  A further review of the Visiting Guidance will take place again on Monday 5 September 2022.    https://web.archive.org/web/20220817111049/https://westerntrust.hscni.net/western-trust-covid-19-information-updates/western-trust-covid19-visiting-guidance/",,2,,3,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,5,,0,,23420826,206151,V,75.01,11.11,11.11,11.11,11.11,18.49,18.49,18.49,18.49,21.13,21.13,21.13,21.13,0.00

The key priority of the autumn programme should be for eligible individuals to be offered a booster vaccine dose to increase their immunity against severe COVID-19 (hospitalisation and death) ahead of winter 2022 to 2023, as described in the previous advice of 15 July 2022.    Simplicity is central to an efficient vaccination programme. Deployment of a single type of vaccine throughout the autumn booster programme promotes simplicity and is therefore desirable. If sufficient doses of mRNA bivalent Original ‘wild-type’/Omicron BA.1 vaccine become available to complete the autumn booster programme, JCVI considers that it is expedient to aim to offer authorised bivalent vaccines throughout the autumn programme, subject to operational considerations. Where substantial delays might be incurred in deploying a bivalent vaccine, the principle of timeliness should take priority and an alternative UK-approved booster vaccine offered, such as a monovalent Original ‘wild-type’ mRNA vaccine. Individuals offered vaccination should be advised that timely boosting is desirable to increase protection over the winter, and therefore to accept whichever booster vaccine is offered.    When there are constraints to vaccine supply or deployment, priority for vaccination should be given to those at higher individual clinical risk of severe COVID-19, such as those of older age.    Vaccination of health and social care workers closer to the winter months would optimise the benefits to the NHS arising from vaccine-induced protection against Omicron symptomatic illness and transmission, as such protection is likely to be of relatively short duration. Operational flexibility is however appropriate in delivery of vaccines to health and social care workers.    The autumn booster vaccine dose should be offered at least 3 months after the previous dose. Operational flexibility may be applied to maximise timely delivery of the autumn programme and in consideration of individual circumstances.    https://web.archive.org/web/20221005155259/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-vaccines-for-autumn-2022-jcvi-advice-15-august-2022/jcvi-statement-on-the-covid-19-booster-vaccination-programme-for-autumn-2022-update-15-august-2022",2.00,0,,,,,"Restrictions remain in place for Western Trust    Visiting Guidance update for Western Trust Hospitals  The Western Trust    visiting guidance to hospital sites will continue to allow two visitors to visit at the same time, for one hour per day, per patient from FOUR nominated visitors. This will be reviewed again on Monday 10 October 2022.    There has been an easing of restrictions to maternity services which will now allow three nominated visitors, an increase from two previously. Partners can now attend twice daily, however the other two nominated visitors can only visit once per day.    Important information on visiting any Western Trust hospital:  Two visitors (from FOUR nominees) are permitted to visit for one hour, once per day at the same time.  Maternity Services – There has been an easing of restrictions to maternity services which will now allow 3 nominated visitors, an increase from two previously. Partners can now also attend twice daily, however the other two nominated visitors can only visit one daily.  Neonatal Units – both parents or two nominated visitors to spend as much time with their baby as they wish.  Children’s Ward – Any child admitted to the Children’s Ward can be accompanied by two people (either/both parents or two nominated caregivers from up to two households), at all times for the duration of the stay.  We would however ask that parents or other nominated visitors swap places (one person at a time at the bedside) to enable us to maintain effective social distancing.  Cancer Services – Ward 50 (North West Cancer Centre) at Altnagelvin will now allow for two nominated persons to visit for one hour, once a week. To keep our patients and staff safe from infection risks, virtual visiting remains the preferred option, in order to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread.  Elective Wards (Wards 3, 21 and 43) at Altnagelvin Hospital and Elective Ward 9 at South West Acute Hospital will now allow one visitor from two nominated visitors to visit for one hour, once per day for post operation patients only. A time slot will need be arranged directly with the Ward.  Based on high risk of COVID-19 transmission it is important to note that some wards are unable to allow visiting at this time and you will be informed of this when you ring to book your visit.  Depending on the continued level of COVID-19 transmission in the community, all temporary measures are subject to review.    https://web.archive.org/web/20221007101233/https://westerntrust.hscni.net/western-trust-covid-19-information-updates/western-trust-covid19-visiting-guidance/",,2,"The primary aim of the COVID-19 autumn booster programme is to increase immunity in those at higher risk of severe COVID-19 during winter 2022 to 2023.

The latest move to relax the restrictions on the estimated 420,000 people living in English care homes was announced as coronavirus rates continue to fall across the country. Almost 95 per cent of residents have received their first dose of the vaccine, while 71 per cent have been jabbed twice.

The step aligns France with the rest of the amber list now that the proportion of beta variant cases has fallen, where those who are fully vaccinated with a vaccine authorised and administered in the UK, US or Europe do not need to quarantine when arriving in England.    This move also simplifies the system to 3 categories, as well as the green watchlist to give travellers notice where green status is at risk.    arrivals from France will no longer need to quarantine if they are fully vaccinated  Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway to be added to the government’s green list for travel  India, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will also be moved from the red to the amber list  Georgia, Mexico, La Reunion and Mayotte added to the red list to safeguard domestic vaccine rollout    https://web.archive.org/web/20210806111415/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/international-travel-country-listings-update",2.00,1,,2.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,1,,3.00,,1.00,,0.00,,0.00,,2.00,0,,,,,,5.00,1,,0.00,,,,,,,,2,,3,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,5,,0,,5225224,114278,V,57.63,23.15,23.15,23.15,23.15,43.49,43.49,43.49,43.49,35.42,35.42,35.42,35.42,100.00

Exceptions will also continue to apply in some areas. All temporary visiting restrictions will be reviewed again on Monday 20 June 2022.    Maternity Services allow one visit, one hour per day from TWO nominated adults at the same agreed time, however consideration will be given outside this in exceptional or individual circumstances. This will also need to be agreed with midwife in charge.    The Trust treats the safety of our patients, staff and everyone attending our facilities with the utmost importance and therefore visitors to healthcare facilities are encouraged to please continue with adherence to infection prevention and control measures in our efforts to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 into high risk and vulnerable settings. Whilst testing using Lateral Flow Devices (LFD) is optional it is encouraged as a valuable, additional mitigation to enhance safety. We would also ask that visitors please wear a face mask when inside our healthcare facilities, even when in the presence of a patient.    http://web.archive.org/web/20220606145531/https://westerntrust.hscni.net/western-trust-covid-19-information-updates/western-trust-covid19-visiting-guidance/",,2,,3,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,5,,0,,,,V,70.91,5.56,5.56,5.56,5.56,21.35,21.35,21.35,21.35,24.40,24.40,24.40,24.40,0.00

This should be implemented as soon as care homes have planned and prepared to do so safely. Local oversight boards can give support and advice to help implement this safely. Updates include (all with safety and infection prevention recommendations to be in place):    Indoor visiting to up to four hours.  Outdoor visiting to up to one hour, with up to six visitors from up to two households.  Children and young people can also be supported to attend.  Increased flexibility around the circumstances and definition of essential visiting, to include visits to prevent or respond to a decline in residents’ health and wellbeing, to help with communication and distress and in end of life care.  Children and young people can be supported to attend essential visits.  No upper time limit for essential visits.  Changes to the designated visitor and circumstances when these should be supported.  Support for touch, and greater involvement with daily routine, to happen safely.  Spiritual and faith representatives supported to visit indoors and outdoors, at all stages of the pandemic, and not regarded as ‘designated visitors’.  Hairdressers supported to visit care homes.  Selected gifts and resident belongings can be brought in.  Arrangements for pets and therapets to be brought in safely.    https://web.archive.org/web/20210101193759/https://www.careinspectorate.com/index.php/coronavirus-professionals/information-for-people-experiencing-care",,0,,0,,,,,,,,0,,0,,39959,2550,NV,0.00,64.81,64.81,64.81,64.81,63.54,63.54,63.54,63.54,58.33,58.33,58.33,58.33,100.00

Transport  A face covering must be worn by all passengers and staff or operators in the following settings:    train services including the Glasgow subway  bus services and the Edinburgh tram  taxi and private hire vehicles  bus stations, railway stations (including open air stations) and airports  ferry services (unless the ferry is open to the elements and physical distancing can be achieved, or the vessel is large enough that physical distancing can be achieved)  airline services  You must wear a face covering before entering any of these settings and must keep it on until you leave unless an exemption applies to you.    Face covering exemptions  Some people are not required to wear a face covering.    These include:    babies, toddlers and children under 5 years of age, due to the possibility of overheating, suffocation and strangulation and they are safe without one  people who have a health condition or who are disabled, including hidden disabilities, for example, autism, dementia or a learning disability, or are providing care for someone with a health condition or disability, where a face covering would be inappropriate because it would cause difficulty, pain or severe distress or anxiety to the wearer or the person in the care of the wearer. This includes children with breathing difficulties and disabled children who would struggle to wear a face covering.  anyone who cannot apply a covering and wear it in the proper manner safely and consistently  police constables or emergency response workers such as paramedics acting in the course of their duty   owners, managers, members of staff, or volunteers, of indoor premises where it is mandatory to wear a face covering who are physically separated, by means of, for example, partition screens, from passengers or customers or if they maintain a 2 metre distance from customers or members of the public  employees undertaking tasks in the course of their employment, where the wearing of a face covering would cause material risk of harm, for example, on the factory floor due to production requirements. Employees should follow existing sector guidance on appropriate controls for preventing the spread of COVID-19 in these settings.    a person leading an act of worship, service, ceremony or registration in a place of worship, or at a funeral, marriage ceremony or civil partnership, where there is a partition screen or a distance of 2 metres is maintained   the couple getting married or entering a civil partnership for the duration of the ceremony or registration provided the couple are 2m apart or separated by a partition, from any other person  anyone who is eating, drinking or exercising  anyone who needs to take medication and cannot do so whilst wearing a face covering  a person who is communicating with someone else who relies on lip reading and facial expressions to communicate; such people should remove the face covering only temporarily whilst communicating and replace it immediately afterwards  anyone who is seeking medical assistance, or acting to avoid injury, illness or harm, and where wearing a face covering would make this more difficult; this also applies if someone needs emergency assistance and they don’t have a face covering with them or there is not time to put one on  a person who is providing care or assistance to a vulnerable person and where wearing a face covering would make this more difficult; this also applies if someone needs to provide emergency assistance and they don’t have a face covering with them or there is not time to put one on  when a relevant person, such as a police officer, asks you to remove your face covering  in a restaurant/café including workplace canteen, bar or other hospitality setting, a person who is seated at a table to eat or drink.  If there is a need to temporarily remove a face covering you should, at all times possible, maintain 2 metres distance as physical distancing is one of the most effective methods of preventing the spread of the virus and removing your face covering places others at an increased risk.    Those exempt under the guidance and regulations do not have to prove their exemption and should not be made to wear a face covering or denied access to places where face coverings are required. We ask for people to be aware of the exemptions and to treat each other with kindness.    https://web.archive.org/web/20201102025109/https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-phase-3-staying-safe-and-protecting-others/pages/face-coverings/#mandatory    ",0.00,,,2.00,1,,,,,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,0,,0,,66012,2849,NV,0.00,67.59,67.59,67.59,67.59,65.10,65.10,65.10,65.10,60.12,60.12,60.12,60.12,100.00

Additionally, the JCVI considered frontline health and social care workers who  provide care to vulnerable people a high priority for initial vaccination. More details  about this are set out in the JCVI’s advice on who should be initially prioritised for  vaccination.  In summary, the JCVI advised that 9 groups of people should be initially prioritised  for vaccination. These are (in order of priority):  1. residents in care homes for older adults and their carers  2. all those 80 years of age and over and frontline health and social care  workers  3. all those 75 years of age and over  4. all those 70 years of age and over and clinically extremely vulnerable  individuals  5. all those 65 years of age and over  6. all individuals aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions  which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality, and unpaid  carers  7. all those 60 years of age and over  8. all those 55 years of age and over  9. all those 50 years of age and over  This approach to prioritisation in the first phase of the vaccination programme was  supported by all 4 UK Nation Chief Medical Officers, in line with the advice from the  JCVI, who agreed that this approach is most likely to achieve the initial aims of  reducing mortality (death) from COVID-19 and maintaining our health and social care   6  systems. Following recent advice from the JCVI, group 6 has also been expanded to  include people experiencing homelessness and rough sleeping.    https://web.archive.org/web/20230216073051/https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/strategy-plan/2021/03/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-deployment-plan-update-march-2021/documents/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-deployment-plan-update---march-2021/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-deployment-plan-update---march-2021/govscot%3Adocument/COVID-19%2Bvaccine%2Bdeployment%2Bplan%2B-%2Bupdate%2B-%2B24%2BMarch%2B2021.pdf",0,,,,,,,,0,,0,,96762,3797,NV,0.00,67.59,67.59,67.59,67.59,65.10,65.10,65.10,65.10,60.12,60.12,60.12,60.12,100.00

However, to be crystal clear, wearing a face covering does not replace the need for social distancing or washing your hands regularly.    “Further scientific evidence is needed on the benefits to the wider public of wearing face coverings, but observational findings so far suggest that homemade or purchased 3 layer face-coverings might reduce transmission from one person to another if made, worn, handled and disposed of properly.    “Therefore, on balance, we are recommending to the people of Wales that 3 layer face-coverings should be used in situations where social distancing measures can be more difficult to achieve, for example, on public transport. We are not recommending their use outdoors.    “The wearing of face coverings will not be mandatory, but we will encourage people to do this for the benefit of themselves and others.""  https://web.archive.org/web/20201005051938/https://gov.wales/3-layer-face-coverings-recommended-not-mandatory-certain-situations-wales",0.00,,,3.00,1,,,,,,,0,,0,,,,,,,,0,,0,,14480,1410,NV,0.00,77.78,77.78,77.78,77.78,74.48,74.48,74.48,74.48,70.83,70.83,70.83,70.83,100.00

The essential visitor may visit the resident regularly indoors during a COVID-19 outbreak at the care home provided the resident or visitor do not themselves have COVID-19 (unless there are exceptional circumstances). This will ensure that people can continue to benefit from regular visits by a nominated essential visitor when wider restrictions on routine visits maybe in place.

Non-vaccinated arrivals must quarantine for 10 days, and must take a PCR test 48 hours prior to departure and then test upon arrival on days 2 and 8.These rules are set to change on 11 February.

Today I can announce that passengers who do not qualify as fully vaccinated will no longer be required to do a day 8 test after arrival or, indeed, to self-isolate. They will still need to fill out a passenger locator form to demonstrate proof of a negative COVID test taken 2 days before travel, and they must also take a post-arrival PCR test.  https://archive.vn/FNxIc",0.00,,,1.00,,,,,,2.00,1,,3.00,,2.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,,5.00,1,,1.00,1,,,,,,,2,,3,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,5,,1,,543685,6501,V,72.08,38.89,26.85,32.87,30.21,48.96,42.19,45.57,44.08,52.38,44.64,48.51,46.80,25.00

The changes will mean people can no longer book a PCR test from Wednesday and all sites will start closing. People will also no longer be able to get free LFT tests unless they have symptoms.    The changes will have major implications for workplaces that have been asking staff to take an LFT test before they start work, whether they have symptoms or not.    New changes mean:    Wednesday, March 30, is the last day the public will be able to book a PCR test if they have symptoms  From Thursday, March 31, all PCR testing sites in Wales will close and free lateral flow tests to support regular asymptomatic testing in workplaces will end except for health and social care workers.  Free lateral flow tests for the public for regular asymptomatic testing will end on Thursday, March 31  From Friday, April 1, if you have Covid symptoms you should use a lateral flow test to check whether you have Covid and from that date, only people eligible for COVID-19 treatments will be able to order PCR tests to be done at home.    http://web.archive.org/web/20220329111757/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/major-changes-covid-testing-wales-23523899",2.00,,,,0.00,,2.00,1,,,,,,5.00,1,,1.00,1,,,,,,,2,,3,,5-15 yrs,5-15 yrs,2,2,2,2,5,,0,,860727,7144,V,75.71,11.11,11.11,11.11,11.11,29.17,29.17,29.17,29.17,29.76,29.76,29.76,29.76,25.00
